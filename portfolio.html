            <p>This was my first attempt at making a profile page, The idea was good, but the colors were a bit too flashy and abrupt. I left the profile image sideways to show my personal growth with web development.</p>

            <h3>Antique Gallery page</h3>
            <p>I created this page for a close personal friend that restores vintage furniture. At the time that I made the page, I thought that they were antiques, however, I learned that there is a difference between the two. An antique is an item that is still in relatively good condition, and has its original paint, decals and materials. A vintage item is an item that has been restored to the original condition, by means of replacing paint, materials and decals.</p>
